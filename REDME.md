## 🧠 How It Works

- When a user adds a task, it's displayed on the screen and saved to `localStorage`.
- On page load, tasks are retrieved from `localStorage` and displayed.
- Users can delete individual tasks or clear all tasks at once.
- All changes are instantly reflected in the `localStorage`.
